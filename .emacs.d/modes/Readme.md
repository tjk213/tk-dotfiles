# EMACS Modes - LLVM

### Original Sources

These files are copied from `llvm-project/llvm/utils/emacs`. Original sources can be found [here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/llvm/utils/emacs).

### Methodology

We don't want to clone the full LLVM repo as a submodule or subtree within `tk-dotfiles`, so instead we just copy the source. We'll need to periodically check for updates.

### Alternatives

*NOTE*: I haven't checked it out, but github user `nverno` claims to have a better `llvm-mode` solution [here](https://github.com/nverno/llvm-mode).
