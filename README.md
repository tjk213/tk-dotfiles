## Repository Access

The most popular protocol for github access is `SSH`. This requires a pair of ssh keys which can be generated with:

```
% ssh-keygen -trsa -C "my_email@isp.com" # Leave passphrase empty
```

Next, upload the public key to your github account in `settings -> SSH & GPG Keys -> New SSH Key`.

If you saved the generated private key in the default file (`$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa`), then you're all set. Otherwise, you can point git to any given keyfile with:

```
% git config --local core.sshcommand 'ssh -i /path/to/my/key'
```

We don't want to assume that all repos on the client machine are using the same key and/or talking to the same github account, so we use `--local` to limit this configuration to repo scope. You can confirm the results with `git config --list --show-scope`.

That's it - your local copy of `tk-dotfiles` (or, perhaps, your user account or whole machine) now has access to your github profile, and from there it can access any repo to which your github account has read/write privileges.

## Installation

Activate any or all of the config files in this repo by symlinking them from your home directory.

**TODO**: Should we write a setup script for creating these links? This could include OS-based conditionals like the one below for `htop`.

### HTOP

On Linux, `.htoprc` can be activated in standard fashion - just link to it from `$HOME/.htoprc`.

On MacOS, `htop` seems to ignore `$HOME/.htoprc`. Instead, link to `tk-dotfiles/.htoprc` from `$HOME/.config/htop/htoprc`.
