## Quickstart

``` bash
% # Install packages & initialize other system-wide settings.
% sudo make init-system USERNAME=tyler
% # Install dotfiles, this will symlink everything from the home dir and therefore
% # overwrite the user's existing files.
% make install-dotfiles
% # Make default directories
% make dirs
```
## Notes on Repo Access

It is sometimes wise to access github with a non-default RSA key. If this is desired, the easiest way to clone the repo is:

```
% GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i /path/to/private/key' git clone git@github.com:tjk213/tk-dotfiles.git
```

Once you've got the repo, you can avoid `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` in the future by pointing git to any given keyfile with:

```
% git config --local core.sshcommand 'ssh -i /path/to/my/key'
```

We don't want to assume that all repos on the client machine are using the same key and/or talking to the same github account, so we use `--local` to limit this configuration to repo scope. (Otherwise, you could run this config prior to the clone and avoid `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` entirely). You can confirm the results with `git config --list --show-scope`.

That's it - your local copy of `tk-dotfiles` (or, perhaps, your user account or whole machine) now has access to your github profile, and from there it can access any repo to which your github account has read/write privileges.
