## Installation

To first order, `tk-dotfiles` can be installed simply by symlinking all dotfiles in this repo from your home directory. Non-dotfiles do not require any setup. Any exceptions & additional steps are outlined below.

### .bashrc & .zshrc

If you'd like, you can directly link the startup files like all other dotfiles but it's probably better to source from your home dir:
```
% echo "source $(realpath .)/.bashrc" >> $HOME/.bashrc
% echo "source $(realpath .)/.zshrc"  >> $HOME/.zshrc
```
This leaves any default system configuration that's been placed in your startup files in place (save for anything that's explicitly overwritten, of course).

### HTOP

`htop` reads its config from `$HOME/.config/htop/htoprc`. So this is the file that must be linked to the desired config:

  - `htop-cpu2.cfg`: 2 columns of CPU meters
  - `htop-cpu4.cfg`: 4 columns of CPU meters
  - `htop-cpu8.cfg`: 8 columns of CPU meters

### CCACHE

In `coreutils.sh`, we set `CCACHE_CONFIGPATH` to point into this repo. This means the local copy of `ccache.conf` will be used automatically; no setup necessary. However, the default _data_ directory for ccache is `$HOME/.ccache/`, which is typically mounted on the system's root filesystem partition. On systems where root partitions have limited capacity, overriding this setting or linking `$HOME/.ccache/` may be advisable.

## Notes on Repo Access

It is sometimes wise to access github with a non-default RSA key. If this is desired, the easiest way to clone the repo is:

```
% GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i /path/to/private/key' git clone git@github.com:tjk213/tk-dotfiles.git
```

Once you've got the repo, you can avoid `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` in the future by pointing git to any given keyfile with:

```
% git config --local core.sshcommand 'ssh -i /path/to/my/key'
```

We don't want to assume that all repos on the client machine are using the same key and/or talking to the same github account, so we use `--local` to limit this configuration to repo scope. (Otherwise, you could run this config prior to the clone and avoid `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` entirely). You can confirm the results with `git config --list --show-scope`.

That's it - your local copy of `tk-dotfiles` (or, perhaps, your user account or whole machine) now has access to your github profile, and from there it can access any repo to which your github account has read/write privileges.
